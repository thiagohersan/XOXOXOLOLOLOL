A few months later, the project was reformulated as a two-day workshop for discussing the effects of the internet on the body. After a short presentation about how the internet works and what is behind some of the more popular sites, we talked about how this technology influences our behavior on- and offline.<br /> <br />

We then used alginate, silicone rubber and other analog materials to create objects for an (inter)active, presential network. Silicone-cast body parts were by far the most popular objects created, and mouths were by far the most popular body part cast.<br /> <br />

Once we had our objects, we performed our network in a town plaza, implicating other objects, humans and animals in our communication rituals.<br /> <br />

When invited to show the project, XOXOXOLOLOLOL became an exhibition inside an exhibition. In order to make visible the idea of a distributed affection network, I invited everyone who had been a part of the project so far to contribute to the installation.<br /> <br />

It ended up becoming a space that explored the way we transfer, translate and transform "things" (objects, ideas, feelings) over networks, and in the process blur the distinctions and relationships between actor/network, node/link, object/subject.<br /> <br />

XOXOXOLOLOLOL é um projeto de projetos. Um espaço expositivo que explora as traduções e movimentos do afeto entre ambientes analógicos e digitais.<br /><br />

Dentro desse espaço expositivo exploramos o limite da padronização, classificação e automatização de nossas interações digitais com projetos que se apropriam das interfaces de aplicativos e redes sociais para ressignificar e personalizar essas formas de comunicação.<br /> <br />
